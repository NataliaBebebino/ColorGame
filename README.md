# ColorGame

This is a project I had to code as part of Plataforma 5 introductory course. <br/>
It consists of a game where you have 2 difficulty modes to play it: either hard or easy version. <br/>
Given a color in RGB format, you have to identify which one of the 6 (hard mode) or 3 (easy mode) colors correspond to that RGB color.<br/>
